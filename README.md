# 🧾 Bill Splitting App  

A simple React application for splitting bills among friends. Easily add friends, enter expenses, and track balances with a clean, user-friendly interface. 🚀  

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Add friends with profile pictures  
- ✅ Enter bill details and split expenses  
- ✅ Track who owes whom and settle balances  
- ✅ Minimal and intuitive UI for easy bill management  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **React** – Component-based UI  
- **CSS** – Styled for a clean look  
- **React State Management** – Lifting state up, shared state, and derived state for better data handling  

## 📚 What I Learned  
While building this app, I improved my understanding of **state management** in React, including:  
- **Lifting State Up** – Managing shared data in a common ancestor component.  
- **Shared State** – Synchronizing data between multiple components.  
- **Derived State** – Computing values dynamically instead of storing redundant state.
